# Roogle 🦉
*Because who needs Google when you have Reddit's brutally honest opinions?*

## What is Roogle?
Roogle is the **search engine** that the internet truly deserves! 🚀 It’s like Google, but instead of giving you polished, SEO-optimized, corporate-approved results, it gives you the **raw, unfiltered, occasionally hilarious, and sometimes too-real opinions from Reddit**.

Why trust a **10/10 shiny review** from a corporate site when you can get **Reddit’s 7/10** “meh, it’s okay” with 500+ upvotes? Roogle brings you the voice of the people, backed by AI to give you the authenticity that only Reddit can provide. Because we all know the internet needs more Reddit in its life, right?

Here’s a professional yet humorous line you can add to the README:

> **Disclaimer**: Roogle is still under construction, so you might encounter a few bugs or hiccups along the way. Also, we're on the free tier of SerpAPI, so if the search results time out—well, let’s just say the robots need a coffee break too. ☕

## Features
- **Reddit-Powered Results**: Why settle for the *"best answer"* when you can have 25 opinions, a meme, and an off-topic argument about pizza?
- **AI Integration**: Crafted with cutting-edge tools like **v0.dev** and **Next.js**. So yes, AI helped build this, but don’t worry, it’s not Skynet. Yet. 🤖
- **No Fake News Here!**: We let Reddit decide what's credible. It's like crowdsourcing the truth, but funnier.
- **Blazing Fast**: Powered by the sleekness of **Next.js**, Roogle doesn't just find answers; it delivers them faster than you can scroll past a political debate on r/AskReddit.

## Usage
Simply type in whatever you're curious about, whether it’s the best keyboard for gaming or what **r/cats** thinks about *your* cat’s weird habit. Roogle will dive deep into the archives of Reddit (via **SerpAPI**) and return the truth, sprinkled with a little humor and a dash of AI magic.

## Why Roogle? 🤔
Because search results should be from the **heart of the internet**, not from a well-polished blog post written by someone who probably didn’t even use the product. Roogle brings you to the source: real people with real opinions (and maybe some bad takes).

---

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: The backbone of modern web development (and also because we like fast stuff).
- **v0.dev**: AI superpowers. Why code manually when AI can handle the heavy lifting?
- **SerpAPI**: The engine that powers our Reddit-focused search results. 🔓
